Wyozi Tag Editor adds tag editing capabilities to servers running TTT and ULX. The script makes it possible to easily allow users to set their own tags, which would be for example an excellent donator feature.

---

##Features

- Edit scoreboard name and tag colors intuitively using a pop-up menu
- Comes with full ULX support: even though colors are set using scoreboard, you can control individual permissions using ULX
- Comes as an addon. Even if TTT updates you don't need to change anything
- ULX Rank fallback: if player has no custom tag their ULX rank can be used. Allows setting a color per default group tag.
- Persistent tags and colors: they're stored in a database and automatically applied when a player joins.
